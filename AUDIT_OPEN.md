**Make SSE output encoding safe for carriage returns and split UTF-8**

- Kind: Confirmed from source
- Evidence: sseWriter.frame splits only on LF and writes raw data after data:. A CR in command output is still a line delimiter in SSE, and arbitrary pipe chunks can split a multibyte character across separately framed events. Writer errors are also discarded.
- Impact: Progress output can be corrupted or interpreted as SSE fields; disconnected streams can continue to appear successfully written.
- Proposed fix: Use a defined JSON/base64 payload per event or a stateful UTF-8-safe encoder that escapes all line terminators. Propagate writer failures so execution/output handling can stop appropriately.
- Acceptance test: Round-trip CR progress output, mixed CRLF, a multibyte code point split across writes, and a writer that fails after one frame.
- Review commit: `00c2d7de021f2e005d53125b833a8ff87033b455` (last reviewed 2026-09-10)


## Resolution log (2026-09-12)

- teploy-sandbox-06, -07, -08: FIXED - bounded reads/uploads (64 MiB each), tunnel registry closed by Pool.Close/Shutdown, duplicate OpenFor now replace-after-close. See audit commits.
- teploy-sandbox-05: PARTIALLY FIXED - writer errors now propagate (a disconnected stream no longer reports successful writes). UPSTREAM: raw CR bytes and UTF-8 chunks split across frames are defined by the pinned SSE frame contract that @neutron-build/agents' SandboxExecutor consumes (it rejoins data: lines with \n); changing the encoding is a contract change owned upstream, not a unilateral fix here.
